 * \page rd1_install_cmake_on_raspbian_7 Install CMake (Raspbian 7)

We use CMake for project generating. Installing CMake on Raspbian is quite straightforward. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using '''sudo'''. Type:

\verbatim
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui  # Recommended, as it contains ccmake.
\endverbatim
